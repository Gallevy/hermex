 * Every rule type hermex has, all firing at once, at three different
 * severities. The primary fixture repo only ever trips three of the ten —
 * so without this repo the rules table has never been reviewed with an
 * `require-engine-version` row, a `require-codeowners` row, or either of the
 * package-field shapes in it, and nothing would catch a renderer that
 * mishandles `fieldPath` / `installedRange` / a long `matchedFiles` list.
 *
 * Scoped to `src/` so `jest.config.js` is found by `no-files` without
 * also being parsed as source — and so `assets/logo.svg`, which exists
 * purely to breach `max-file-size`, is never parsed either.
